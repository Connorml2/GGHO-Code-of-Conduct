4. Anticompetitive practices.
 	- Hosts *must not* engage in actions, marketing campaigns, or any action targeting a specific competing host. This includes but is not limited to:
 		* "Smear" campaigns
 		* Posting on another's forum topic
 		* Libel
 		* Domain name "sniping"
 		* Denial of Service attacks
    - In this instance domain name sniping is specified as purchasing a domain name pertinant to the opposition's company while that company is still in business and/or registering a domain name directly after registration has lapsed assuming the company is still in operation. In both cases if the company has rebranded/shuts down (IE no longer lays no claim to the name) there is a 30 day period before you can register a domain.
 	- It is *disallowed* to carry out an attack of any kind on another party, be it a customer, host, or 3rd party organisation.
 	- In addition, generally anticompetitive practices are *disallowed*. This includes:
 		- Dumping for an extended period of time
 		- Price fixing
 		- Tying
