3. Customer Interaction Requirements 
	- In order to protect customers from inactive service providers, and service providers with extremely poor “client to staff” communication, the following requirements have been set in place.
		* A service provider *must* have a support system available for at least eight hours a day.
		* The support system *must* allow for the selection of services which have been troubled.
		* It is *recommended* that email support accounts be monitored for at least 10 hours a day. We recommend against email support as the primary support system, due to tracking issues.
		* We *recommend* that service providers implement a live support facility on their website.
	- A GGHO Representative may visit your website URL to begin a live chat session, or open a support ticket if live chat is offline. This is to judge the quality of the support representatives. GGHO representatives will not bait your staff into making detrimental statements - they are merely instructed to take the role of an interested, prospective customer.
	- We require that our service providers maintain an acceptable level of support. We require all service providers to respond to 90% of tickets within 18 hours. We suggest that all our service providers offer a 4 hour response SLA with their clients.
