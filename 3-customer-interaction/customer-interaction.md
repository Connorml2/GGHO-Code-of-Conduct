2. Customer Interaction Requirements 
	-In order to protect customers from inactive service providers, and service provider with extremely poor “client to staff” communication, the following requirements have been set in place.
		* A service provider must have a Support Ticket Module monitored for at least 10 hours a day.
		* The Support Ticket Module must allow for the selection of services which have been troubled.
		* Email Support has no requirements, but is recommended that it be monitored for at least 10 hours a day. GGHO recommends against email support, due to tracking issues. We recommend that you ‘pipe’ your emails to your support system.
		* We recommend that service providers implement a live support facility on their site.
	- A GGHO Representative may visit your website URL to begin a live chat session, or open a support ticket if live chat is offline. This is to judge the quality of the support representatives. GGHO representatives will NOT bait you into saying things that may decrease your chances of being accepted into GGHO.
	- We require that our service providers maintain an acceptable level of support. We require all service providers to respond to 90% of tickets within 18 hours. We suggest that all our service providers offer a 4 hour response SLA with their clients.
