##Introduction

This code of conduct is in place to ensure member service providers follow the required standards enforced by GGHO. Hosts may be audited at any time, without prior warning, to insure compliance with these codes. If a host fails all or part of one of the codes, their membership will be reviewed by the Committee, and appropriate action will be taken.

Referrals, suspension, or removal of subsidiary companies may result in loss of reputation of their parent company.
